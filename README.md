If you choose to use local Redis we strongly recommend using Docker. If you choose not to use Docker, use the following instructions based on your OS:

sudo docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest

‚ùØ go run ./cmd/spider/main.go

I hate race conditions :(


SILENE TEST DRIVEN DEVEVLOPER


The main problem that docker solves is hte "It works on my machine"
